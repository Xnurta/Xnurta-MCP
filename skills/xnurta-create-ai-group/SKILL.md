# Create AI Managed Group

Create a new AI managed group. SD creation requires campaigns; SP/SB creation may
create an empty group or include campaigns. This is a
**write, non-idempotent** operation: calling it twice creates two groups. Read
[`references/platform-notes.md`](references/platform-notes.md) once before your
first write - it covers auth, the shared response envelope, the 30s-timeout rule,
and how errors come back (`data.error` + an optional `recoveryHint` that isn't always
populated, so some stay generic).

## The one thing that decides everything: ad type

Creation logic differs by ad type, and they use **different tools**. Your first job
is always to determine the campaign type, then route:

| Ad type | Tool | Read before building the call |
|---|---|---|
| **SD** (Sponsored Display) | `create_sd_ai_managed_group` | [`references/create-sd.md`](references/create-sd.md) |
| **SP / SB** (Sponsored Products / Brands) | `save_sp_sb_ai_managed_group` (leave `aiGroupId` empty -> create mode) | [`references/create-sp-sb.md`](references/create-sp-sb.md) |

How to determine the ad type, in order of preference:
1. The user says it ("SP 托管组", "for my Sponsored Display campaigns").
2. Infer it from the campaigns to be added - look them up and read `campaignType`.
3. If still unknown, **ask the user** - don't guess. A group is created for one ad
   type; picking the wrong tool creates the wrong kind of group.

> SP and SB both go through `save_sp_sb_ai_managed_group`, but a few capabilities
> are SP-only (see `create-sp-sb.md`). SB is not SP - don't copy SP-only fields
> into an SB group.

> **Reads use the full signature.** Every `get_entity_metadata` call requires
> `profileIds`, `entity`, and `userContext` -
> `get_entity_metadata(profileIds=[<id>], entity='campaign', userContext='<why>')`.
> The shorthand `get_entity_metadata(entity='campaign')` fails; always pass all three.

## Disambiguate before writing (when in doubt, ASK - don't guess)

Everyday words - in English OR Chinese - map to different fields. Before setting a value,
be sure which field the user means; if it could be more than one, list the options and
ask - don't guess.

This section lists **business meanings only** - the exact field depends on ad type, so
confirm the meaning first, then use the ad-type reference to pick the field.

- **"budget" / "预算"** - decide the sense AND whether it's a **target value** or an
  **increase**:
  - **托管组总预算 / group total budget** (= sum of the group's enabled campaigns' daily
    budgets) and **a single campaign's daily budget** are **target values**. Note: **a
    single campaign's daily budget cannot be set through the managed-group tools** (it's
    campaign-level - use the platform).
  - **按表现调预算 / performance (dynamic) budget** is an **increase cap on top of the
    current budget, NOT a target** (fixed `+$num` or `+num%`); its scope depends on **预算
    重新分配** (OFF = per enabled campaign; ON = whole group). See
    [`references/coupling-rules.md`](references/coupling-rules.md).
  - **预算重新分配 / budget reallocation** - a switch that also changes the scope of 按表现调预算.
  Which field, at create time:
  - **SD** uses `budget` + `budgetChange` (a boolean toggle) - **there is no `budgetType`
    at create** (`budgetType`/`budgetRatio` are edit/batch only).
  - **SP/SB create has no group-budget input at all** - only budget-related action-space
    switches. If the user wants an SP/SB group's spend budget set at creation, tell them
    that's not a create-time field here.
  Never map "set budget to X" (a target) onto the dynamic-budget increase value; if the
  meaning isn't clear, ask. When enabling 按表现调预算 at create, **set 预算重新分配
  explicitly** - its scope (per-campaign vs whole-group) depends on it; don't rely on an
  unknown default. To preview a cap, base it on the **enabled** campaigns among those
  you're adding (use each one's `dailyBudget`).
- **"target / goal" / "目标"**: 推广目标 `targetType` (1 growth / 2 stability / 3 volume /
  4 legacy) vs 目标 ACOS (`acos`). **Create has no `roas` field** - if the user says
  "目标 ROAS", do NOT build `roas`; tell them create can't set a target ROAS directly, and
  ask whether they want to set the promotion target or convert it to a target ACOS. Also:
  "ACOS 优先模式 / ACOS priority" is the strict-ACOS switch (see the ACOS-priority item
  below), **not** setting a target ACOS value - don't confuse them.
- **AI on/off at creation**: see "AI on vs off at creation" below - only start AI if the
  user explicitly asked to create-and-start.
- **"ACOS 优先模式 / strict ACOS / ACOS priority"** (`bidPerformanceStrictAcosStatus`) - a
  sub-switch of 按表现调价, **SP only**, and only triggers with `targetType=2` +
  `bidPerformanceStatus=1` + `aiPersonality>=3`. It's a tradeoff (may underspend / reduce
  orders) - confirm with the user before enabling. See
  [`references/coupling-rules.md`](references/coupling-rules.md).

## Workflow (same for every ad type)

1. **Resolve inputs to IDs and codes.**
   - **Campaigns -> internal `campaignId`.** Look them up with
     `get_entity_metadata(profileIds=[...], entity='campaign', userContext='...')`.
     Each row has both `campaignId` (internal auto-increment int) and
     `amazonCampaignId` (Amazon's long string ID). **Always pass `campaignId` into
     `campaignIds`; never `amazonCampaignId`** - the Amazon ID is a ~20-digit value
     that overflows the int32 the tool expects and the call fails. The lookup also
     gives each campaign's `campaignType` (routing) and `aiGroupId` (conflict check).
     - **A `campaignId` from `get_ads_perf` may be the Amazon long ID, not the internal
       one.** Never feed a `campaignId` taken from `get_ads_perf` straight into
       `campaignIds` - first map it through `get_entity_metadata` (match on
       `amazonCampaignId`) to the internal `campaignId`. Only the internal int works.
   - **One profile, one ad type.** A create targets a single `profileId`, and every
     campaign must belong to that profile and share the same `campaignType`. If the
     user mixes profiles or mixes SP + SB (or gives a name that matches campaigns in
     several stores), stop and clarify - don't silently pick a store or mis-route.
   - **Chinese terms -> codes.** Map Chinese goal wording ("推动增长", "活动冲量",
     "保持订单稳定", "激进人格") to the right field + code via
     [`references/enum-i18n.md`](references/enum-i18n.md) before building the call,
     and translate back when you confirm/report.
2. **Map the request to a single business meaning** (see "Disambiguate before writing").
   Especially for budget/target wording, decide exactly what the user wants set and which
   field it is (after ad type is known). **If more than one meaning is plausible, STOP and
   ask - don't build a create on a guessed interpretation.**
3. **Pre-flight checks:**
   - **Name uniqueness.** The `aiGroupName` filter is a `like` (substring) match, not
     exact - query `get_entity_metadata(profileIds=[...], entity='aiGroup',
     filters={"aiGroupName": {"like": "%<name>%"}}, userContext='...')`, then compare names
     **exactly** in the returned rows. If an exact match exists, ask for a different
     name rather than letting the create fail.
   - **Name not blank, and ≤ 200 characters.** Reject a pure-whitespace / trims-to-empty
     name yourself - the UI blocks it, MCP doesn't. The UI also caps the name at **200
     characters**; the API doesn't state a limit, so treat 200 as the safe ceiling and
     shorten with the user's agreement rather than sending something longer. A duplicate
     name comes back from the backend as `aiGroupName is exist` (code `124025`) - the
     pre-flight check above is what keeps you from hitting it.
   - **Already-managed campaigns (checkable).** A campaign already in another managed
     group shows a non-empty `aiGroupId` in its metadata - flag those, let the user
     decide.
   - **Budget-management conflict (NOT pre-checkable).** Campaign metadata does not
     expose budget-management membership, so you cannot verify this up front - only
     the backend create can reject it. Don't claim conflicts are fully cleared; say
     the budget-management check happens server-side.
4. **Confirm before creating - show everything that will take effect.** Echo the
   **complete** config, not just the basics: ad type, group name, the campaigns (by
   name), `targetType`/`optimizeType`, target ACOS, budget settings, `aiPersonality`,
   `campaignNameSign`, and **every supported action-space switch you're enabling**
   (bid / budget / target / struct optimization). For anything you're not
   setting, say it will use the platform default - but **don't invent specific default
   values** (the tool schema doesn't define them); only state a concrete default if
   you've read it back or it's documented. Get an explicit go-ahead - and note that **the
   user answering an earlier clarification question is not itself authorization to create**;
   you still need an explicit yes on this full preview before calling the create tool. This
   matters most when AI will start on (`aiStatus=1`) - those switches immediately affect
   live delivery and spend.
   - **Turn AI on only if the user explicitly asked to start it.** If they said "create
     and start" / "启动", set AI on. If they only asked to set up / create the group or
     place campaigns into it (or didn't say), default AI **off** (`aiStatus` / `status`
     = 0) and state that in your confirmation. Don't start automation on settings the
     user didn't confirm.
5. **Build and call the routed tool** using the exact **write** field names + enum
   values (ad-type reference + `field-reference.md`; write names != read names).
   > **Create is non-idempotent - never blind-retry.** On any failure, timeout, or
   > missing response, the group **may already have been created**. Before retrying,
   > re-query by name (`get_entity_metadata entity='aiGroup'`, exact-match the
   > `smartCreationName`/`aiGroupName`); only create again if it truly does not exist.
   > A blind retry creates a duplicate group.

   **Before sending, self-validate the front-end-only rules MCP bypasses** (see
   platform-notes "MCP bypasses the platform UI's validation"):
   - **Action-space support** - only enable a capability that supports AI for this ad
     type ([`references/action-space-matrix.md`](references/action-space-matrix.md));
     if the user asked for one that isn't supported for their ad type, tell them and
     skip it - don't send a silently-ignored field.
   - **Budget** - sanity-check what you reliably can (positive; JP integer-only;
     multi-campaign minimum scales with campaign count). Exact per-site/account ranges
     are only partly known and the backend may enforce them, so relay backend range
     errors rather than hard-blocking on an incomplete table
     ([`references/budget-limits.md`](references/budget-limits.md)).
   - **aiPersonality** `1`-`5`, and **>=3 when `targetType=3` (volume / 冲量)**.
   - **Coupled fields** - enabling a switch requires its companion fields, and any
     range must have min <= max (see [`references/coupling-rules.md`](references/coupling-rules.md)).
   - **Invalid values are rejected by the backend now - but pre-validate anyway** so the
     user gets a clear message instead of a downstream error (prod-confirmed 2026-08-13):
     `acos` must be > 0 and in range (`0`, negatives, and over-limit are all rejected);
     `aiPersonality` outside `1`-`5` is rejected; `campaignIds` is capped at **1000** per
     group; and a coupled field sent without its companion is rejected. At **create** the
     real budget couplings are: **SD budget** = `budgetChange` + `budget`; **SD dynamic
     budget** = `budgetDynamicStatus` + `numType` + `num`; **SP/SB dynamic budget** = the
     action-space switch + `budgetNumType` + `budgetNum`. (`acosType`/`budgetType`/
     `budgetRatio` are **edit/batch** fields - do **not** put them in a create call.)
     Catch these up front rather than leaning on the backend error.
   - **Word-list settings are not supported.** Do not send branded, non-branded,
     competitor, harvest-blacklist, or negative-target-blacklist fields, even if the
     routed schema exposes them. Tell the user to configure word lists in the platform.
6. **Verify it landed - group AND campaigns.** Don't trust the envelope alone:
   - Re-read the group (`entity='aiGroup'`) -> confirm it exists with the intended
     top-level settings.
   - Re-read `entity='campaign'` and check each intended campaign's `aiGroupId` now
     points at the new group - the group can exist with fewer campaigns than you sent.
   - **SP/SB: a `success` response can still leave an EMPTY group.** `save_sp_sb_ai_managed_group`
     may create the group without immediately binding `campaignIds`. So after create,
     count how many of your campaigns actually have `aiGroupId` = the new group. **If the
     bound count is 0 (or short), re-attach via edit mode**: call `save_sp_sb_ai_managed_group`
     again with the returned `aiGroupId` (> 0) and the full `campaignIds`, then re-verify.
   - **Reading back binding: query per campaign, not one big `in` list.** In some
     environments an `campaignId: {"in":[...]}` filter throws a backend type error.
     If a batched filter errors, fall back to per-id `campaignId = <id>` reads (or another
     confirmed-usable field). This applies to both the pre-create mapping and this check.
   - `aiActionSettings` / `aiAutomation` read back as a projection of what's currently
     effective, not as the raw write payload: disabled dependencies and AI-mode rules can
     be omitted. Verify the paired action-space switch first, then interpret retained rule
     config. If the projection cannot prove a requested setting, say "created, but this
     setting couldn't be independently confirmed" rather than treating omission as a
     failed write.
   - If operation-log read access is available, query `get_operation_log` and confirm
     the create is recorded against an identifiable token user. The server supplies
     `changedBy`; never send or fabricate it. If logs cannot be read, state that audit
     verification was not performed.

## Scheduling is a separate tool (not a create-time field)

There are still **no** `scheduleType` / `scheduleDate` / `scheduleStartDate` /
`scheduleEndDate` fields on the create tools - don't invent them. But scheduling itself is
now available: **`save_sp_sb_ai_group_schedule`** creates, updates, and deletes SP/SB group
schedules, and `get_entity_metadata(entity='aiGroup_schedule')` reads them.

So when a user says "create the group and have it run this promo window":

1. Create the group first (this skill), capture the returned `aiGroupId`.
2. Then call `save_sp_sb_ai_group_schedule` with that `aiGroupId` (see
   `xnurta-edit-ai-group` for the parameter contract).

Two things to state up front rather than discovering mid-flow: schedules are **SP/SB only**
(there is no SD schedule tool), and a **weekly** schedule (`timeType=2`) inherits
`optimizeType` / `acos` / `aiPersonality` from the group - passing those on a weekly
schedule is rejected. A fixed-window schedule (`timeType=1`) carries its own values.

## Creating from a template

A managed group **can** now be created from a platform template via `templateId`.

- **Read templates with `get_ai_group_template`** - no args returns the list (`searchName`
  for a fuzzy name match, `createdBy`, `page`, `pageLimit` default 50, `applyFlag=1` to
  include system presets); pass `templateId` to get one template's full detail. Note this
  read sits behind the **write** scope.
- **Apply it** by passing `templateId` (>0) to `create_sd_ai_managed_group` or
  `save_sp_sb_ai_managed_group`. The template supplies defaults for `acos`, `optimizeType`,
  `status`, `budgetDynamicStatus`, `numType`, `num`, `campaignNameSign`,
  `targetHarvestStatus`, `budgetRedistributeStatus`, `aiPersonality`, plus the action-space
  and automation config.
- **Anything you pass explicitly wins over the template value.** Fields you omit fall back
  to the template. So "use template X but with a 25% ACOS target" is one call: `templateId`
  plus `acos: 25`.
- **You still supply the identity and membership yourself**: `profileId`,
  `smartCreationName`, `campaignIds`. Templates don't carry those. `budget` /
  `budgetChange` are also **not** template-controlled on SD.
- **One template restriction is a hard error.** If the template's target-harvest (rule 4) or
  negative-target (rule 5) config is bound to *specific campaigns and ad groups*
  (`isSelf=2` with the rule enabled), the call is rejected - this tool can't carry those
  bindings. The error names the offending rules. Tell the user to either apply that template
  in the platform UI, or pick a template whose rules use "current object" scope.
- **Templates are not tied to an ad type, and a cross-type apply is handled for you.**
  Applying an SP template to an SB group works: the server zeroes the SP-only fields the
  template carries (`bidAmazonBusinessStatus`, `btbRangeStatus`/`btbMin`/`btbMax`,
  `bidDaypartStatus`, `bidPerformanceStrictAcosStatus`,
  `bidAdPlaceStatus`/`bidAdPlaceRangeStatus`, `tos`/`pdp`/`ros` bounds,
  `structPauseProductStatus`/`structPauseCampaignStatus`) instead of erroring.
  **But this only happens when you leave `aiActionSettings` out of your call.** If you send
  `aiActionSettings` yourself, the template's action-space config is skipped entirely (yours
  wins, it is not merged) and the normal SB compatibility check applies - an SP-only field
  with a non-zero value then fails the whole request. So when applying a template
  cross-type, don't also hand-build `aiActionSettings`; and tell the user those SP-only
  parts of the template won't take effect on an SB group.
- **Templates are read-only through MCP.** You cannot create, edit, or delete a template,
  and you cannot save a group's settings back as one - that's platform-only. Say so rather
  than attempting a workaround.

Before applying a template, it's worth reading its detail and telling the user what it will
set - especially the AI on/off (`status`) value, since a template can start AI immediately.

## AI on vs off at creation

`aiStatus` (SP/SB) / `status` (SD) decides whether AI starts optimizing immediately.
Turn it on **only when the user explicitly asked to create-and-start**. If they just
want the group set up (or didn't say), default to AI **off** and say so in your
confirmation - turning AI on means it starts adjusting bids/budgets and spending against
the target right away.

> Note: an "off" group reads back as `aiStatus=2` ("AI Turned Off"), not `0`. Don't
> treat a non-zero `aiStatus` on read as "it's on" - `1` = running, `2` = off.

## Enum discipline

`optimizeType` / `targetType` / `status` / `aiStatus` / `targetHarvestStatus` /
`numType` / `aiPersonality` and the `aiActionSettings` switches are closed enums.
Use only the values listed in
[`references/field-reference.md`](references/field-reference.md) - do not invent or
infer values. Passing an unlisted value makes the call fail, and the error comes back
generic (no field-level hint), so validate against the dictionary **before** sending
rather than relying on the error to tell you what was wrong. For mapping the user's
Chinese wording to these codes (and back), use
[`references/enum-i18n.md`](references/enum-i18n.md).

## Response & errors

Success looks like `{ "isError": false, "data": { "status": "success", "result": {
"aiGroupId": <new id> } } }` - capture `aiGroupId` for the verify step.

Errors come back as `{ "isError": true, "data": { "error": "...", "recoveryHint":
"..." } }`. Relay `recoveryHint` when present, but it isn't always populated - some
come back generic - so still map the common ones yourself:

| Symptom | Likely cause | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| duplicate-name / "Duplicate group name" | name already used in this profile | ask for a different name |
| "Campaign conflict" | a campaign is already in another AI group / budget mgmt | surface which campaign; drop it or free it first |
| generic `business_error` | often an out-of-range/invalid field value | re-check every value against `field-reference.md` |
| timeout (~30s, no response) | the create may have already applied downstream | **verify with a read before retrying** - a blind retry can create a duplicate group |
