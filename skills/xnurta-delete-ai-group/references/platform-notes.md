# Platform notes - managed-group write tools

Shared behavior for the managed-group write tools (`create_sd_ai_managed_group`,
`save_sp_sb_ai_managed_group`, `edit_sd_ai_managed_group`, `delete_ai_managed_group`,
`save_sp_sb_ai_group_schedule`) and the template read tool (`get_ai_group_template`).
This file ships inside each managed-group skill so it travels with the skill.

## Tool map

| Tool | What it does | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `create_sd_ai_managed_group` | Create an SD managed group | `amazon_sa_managed_group:write` |
| `save_sp_sb_ai_managed_group` | Create or edit an SP/SB managed group (single or batch) | `amazon_sa_managed_group:write` |
| `edit_sd_ai_managed_group` | Edit SD managed groups (batch by `ids`) | `amazon_sa_managed_group:write` |
| `save_sp_sb_ai_group_schedule` | Create / update / delete SP/SB group schedules | `amazon_sa_managed_group:write` |
| `get_ai_group_template` | Read managed-group templates (list / detail) | `amazon_sa_managed_group:write` |
| `delete_ai_managed_group` | Delete (archive) a group, releasing or migrating campaigns | `amazon_sa_managed_group_delete:write` |

Two things worth noting: `get_ai_group_template` is a **read** operation that sits behind
the **write** scope (a read-only token cannot list templates), and delete has its own
separate scope — a token that can create/edit may still be unable to delete.

**Templates are read-only.** There is no MCP tool that creates, edits, or deletes a
template. `get_ai_group_template` reads them; the write tools *apply* one via `templateId`.
If a user asks to "save these settings as a template", tell them that has to be done in the
platform UI.

## Enforce the constraints yourself - for clear errors and to catch what slips through

When a user acts through the platform UI, the front end blocks invalid input (greys
out fields, hides unsupported options, caps ranges). **Through MCP, none of that UI
guarding runs.** Prod testing (2026-08-13) shows the backend now validates a lot on its
own - enum/type checks, ACOS/ROAS/personality ranges, `*Type`<->value companions, `ids`
size, profile authorization, `remark` length - and **rejects** those bad calls rather
than silently accepting them. That's good, but it isn't a licence to send sloppy input:
some combinations are still accepted unexpectedly or silently ignored (e.g. an
unsupported ad-type action-space switch on the wrong ad type), and a downstream
rejection is a worse experience than a precise up-front message.

Therefore: **treat the constraints in this skill as rules you enforce yourself, before
sending** - both to give the user a clear error and to catch the cases the backend
doesn't.

## Unsupported features -> tell the user, don't send

Some settings don't apply in a given context - a wrong ad type, an unsupported mode, or
a feature not available yet. **Several of these are now hard errors** rather than silent
no-ops, and the error arrives *instead of* any part of your write being applied:

- **SP-only action-space fields sent for an SB group** -> rejected, listing every offending
  field (`X is not supported for sponsoredBrands; remove it or set to 0`).
- **A non-SD group id sent to `edit_sd_ai_managed_group`** -> rejected with a pointer to
  `save_sp_sb_ai_managed_group`.
- **SP-only batch operations on a batch containing SB groups** -> rejected.
- **`optimizeType`, `acos`, or `aiPersonality` on a weekly (`timeType=2`) schedule** ->
  rejected; those are inherited from the parent group.
- **A template whose harvest/negative rules are bound to specific campaigns/ad groups**
  (`isSelf=2` with `status=1`) -> rejected, because this tool can't carry those bindings.
- **A group whose `campaignType` can't be determined on delete** -> rejected rather than
  guessed.

Others are still accepted-but-ignored. So the rule stands: **if the user asks for something
not supported in their context, tell them plainly and skip that field - never send it
silently and never present it as if it took effect.**

## Auth & scope

- Authenticate via bearer token. Always call `get_user_authorized_context` first to
  get authorized `profileId`s; pass only an authorized one.
- `tenantId` / `userId` / `userName` are injected server-side from the token - never
  pass or fabricate them.
- Writes require `amazon_sa_managed_group:write`. **Delete requires
  `amazon_sa_managed_group_delete:write`** - a token that can create/edit may still not be
  able to delete. See the tool map above.
- **A profileId outside the token's grant is rejected outright** (`profileId X is not
  authorized for the current user`) - nothing partial is applied. Take profile IDs verbatim
  from `get_user_authorized_context`.

## Response envelope

Success:
```json
{ "isError": false, "toolName": "<tool>", "requestId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "data": { "status": "success", "result": { "aiGroupId": 827136 } } }
```

Failure - **there are two shapes**, distinguished by whether the failure came from the tool
or from the surrounding pipeline:
```json
{ "isError": true, "toolName": "<tool>", "requestId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "errorType": "invalid_params", "message": "<message>", "recoveryHint": "<hint, if any>" }
```
```json
{ "isError": true, "errorType": "business_error", "service": "Amazon_SA_Service",
  "message": "<downstream message>" }
```

- Check `isError` first, then read the top-level `errorType`. All pipeline failures (`rate_limited`, `token_invalid`, `permission_denied`, `scope_missing`, `business_error`, `timeout`) and parameter/validation failures use `errorType`. A tool's own business failure instead carries a nested `data.error` (+ optional `data.recoveryHint`) — see "Errors" below.
- **The configured write budget is 20 calls/min** per tenant+tool and per user+tool (reads
  get 120); whether limiting is enabled is an environment setting, so treat it as a ceiling
  to plan against rather than something you can count on being off. A serial "write, read
  back, write, read back" loop over many groups can hit it - pace it, and on `rate_limited`
  wait `retryAfterSeconds` rather than retrying immediately.
- `requestId` is your support handle. **Quote it when reporting a failed write to the
  user.**
- When `recoveryHint` is present, use it and relay it to the user.

**Batch results are three-state - don't judge by `isError` alone.** A batch operation
can partially succeed and still come back with `isError:false`:

```json
{ "isError": false, "data": {
    "status": "partial_failure",
    "result": { "success": 1, "fail": 2 },
    "failedItems": [ { "aiGroupId": 1002, "error": "aiStatus is not on" } ] } }
```

`status` is `success` / `partial_failure` / (all-failed ->) `isError:true`. If
`failedItems` names the failures, derive and verify the succeeded set. If it is empty,
re-read every requested id because counts alone cannot identify which items succeeded.
Never present a partial result as full success.

## Errors: prefer the hint, but don't rely on it

The failure shape carries `data.error` and an optional `data.recoveryHint`, and the
batch layer translates some downstream codes into readable messages (e.g. "Budget must
be between 50 and 500", "Operation 'budget' requires: budgetType"). But **not every
error is populated with a useful hint** - some downstream business errors still come
back generic (e.g. `"业务执行错误"`, `"Resource Not Found"`), and parameter values are
validated downstream, not by the tool. So: get the request right the first time by
sticking to the documented fields/enums; relay `recoveryHint` when it's there, and don't
assume it always will be.

## Non-idempotent + 30s timeout

Create and SP/SB save are **non-idempotent** - each call creates/changes state. The
downstream call can take up to ~30s; on timeout the operation may already have
applied. **Always verify with a `get_entity_metadata(profileIds=[...],
entity='aiGroup', userContext='...')` read before retrying** - a blind retry can
create a duplicate group. (`get_entity_metadata` requires `profileIds`, `entity`,
`userContext` on every call.)

## Verify, don't trust the envelope

A `status: success` envelope does not by itself prove the intended state. Some edits
on an AI-running group can be silently skipped downstream. After any write, read the
group back with `get_entity_metadata(profileIds=[...], entity='aiGroup',
userContext='...')` and confirm the fields you set actually took the values you
expected.

### ⚠️ Read-back returns the *currently effective* config - a missing field is not a failure

`get_entity_metadata`'s `aiGroup` response is a projection, not the raw stored record. It is
first trimmed to what the group's `campaignType` supports, then reduced to what is actually
in effect:

- a switch that is **off** drops its dependent fields (turn `bidAdPlaceStatus` off and
  `tosMin`/`tosMax`/`pdpMin`/`pdpMax`/`rosMin`/`rosMax` disappear entirely);
- a rule running in **AI mode** is **omitted from `aiAutomation` altogether**. An empty
  `aiAutomation` is ambiguous by itself: pair it with the effective `aiActionSettings`
  switches to distinguish action spaces that are off from enabled action spaces in AI mode;
- a rule in **Rule mode** keeps its config but drops AI-only parameters.

So verify in this order:

1. Read back the **switch** you set and confirm its value.
2. Only then look for its dependent fields - and only expect them if the switch is on.
3. Treat "field absent under an off switch" as **expected**, never as evidence the write
   failed. Equally, don't diff two read-backs field-by-field and call every disappearance a
   regression: flipping one switch off legitimately removes a whole family of fields.

When you can't confirm a value because it isn't returned, say that plainly ("the switch is
off, so that parameter isn't in effect and isn't reported") rather than guessing at a stored
value or re-sending the write.

For multiple writes against the same object set, execute serially and read back after
each call. Never run dependent writes concurrently. When operation-log read access is
available, also verify the resulting audit entry; `changedBy` is server-derived.
