# Query Entity Metadata Skill

## MCP Tool

This skill maps to MCP tool: **`get_entity_metadata`**. Required scope: `amazon_sa_ads_configuration:read`.

Profile scope is resolved from the authenticated bearer token. `profileIds` is **required** — always call `get_user_authorized_context` first to obtain authorized profile IDs, then pass one or more into `profileIds`. **Every requested ID must be authorized: one unauthorized value fails the entire call** with `invalid_params` / `Requested profileIds contain unauthorized values` — nothing is silently dropped (see Platform-Wide Rules below). If the user didn't specify a store, pass **all** authorized `profileIds`. Never pass `tenantId` or `userId`; the server derives them from the token.

**`entity='aiGroup_schedule'` is stricter: it requires exactly one `profileId`.** See the dedicated section below.

**`userContext` (required)**: Each call must include a non-empty string. Preserve the user's original query as much as possible, plus the agent's reason for calling this tool. Summarize if too long, max 100 characters.

## Platform-Wide Rules

**Before using this tool, read [`references/platform-notes.md`](references/platform-notes.md)** — it covers auth flow, permission scopes, error handling, pagination tables, the Ratio Metric Display Rule (including `targetAcos`), currency rules, the tool-selection decision tree, and implicit inference rules shared across all 3 read tools. That file ships inside this same skill folder, so it travels with this skill regardless of how it's packaged/installed. This SKILL.md only covers what's specific to `get_entity_metadata`.

## When to Use

Use this tool when the user needs any of the following:
- Query entity metadata (name, status, config, etc)
- Find entity lists (e.g. all enabled campaigns, AI group list, portfolios with a budget set)
- Get entity configuration info (budget settings, bidding strategy, AI group targets, current keyword bid)
- Discover ad structure relationships (which AdGroups under a Campaign, ASIN ownership, which automation rules are enabled on a campaign)
- Search entities by condition (name fuzzy match, status filter, bid/budget threshold filter)
- Count entities (e.g. how many campaigns, how many portfolios have a budget)

**⚠️ Counting entities requires paging through all results, not just reading page 1's `rowCount`.** `rowCount` is the number of rows on the *current page only* — it is not a total count. To answer "how many X are there", loop `page` (incrementing each call) while `hasNextPage` is `true`, summing each page's `rowCount` as you go; the running total once `hasNextPage` is `false` is the real count. Consider raising `pageSize` to the max (500) first to reduce the number of round trips. Do not report a page-1 `rowCount` as if it were the full answer.

**Note**: This tool does NOT involve time range or performance metrics. For spend, clicks, ACOS etc, use `get_ads_perf`.

**Note**: This tool does NOT return historical point-in-time snapshots — it only returns the entity's *current* configuration. There is no `asOfDate`-style parameter, and this tool has no date parameters at all. If the user asks "what was the daily budget on 2026-03-26", that specific historical value cannot be retrieved with this tool; only the current value is available. Say so explicitly rather than guessing.

See the Tool Selection Decision Tree above if the user's ask might belong to `get_ads_perf` or `get_operation_log` instead.

## Required Parameter: `entity`

Unlike `get_ads_perf` (which infers tables from `select`), `get_entity_metadata` requires you to **explicitly declare which entity you're querying** via the `entity` parameter. Omitting it is the most common cause of a failed call (`errorType: invalid_params`).

## DSL Parameter Format

```json
{
  "userContext": "User's original query + agent's calling reason",
  "entity": "campaign",
  "profileIds": [1234567890123456],
  "filters": {},
  "orderBy": [{"field": "fieldName", "direction": "ASC"}],
  "select": ["campaignId", "campaignName", "campaignState"],
  "page": 1,
  "pageSize": 100
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| profileIds | array[long] | **Yes** | — | Profile IDs from `get_user_authorized_context.profileIds`. **All must be authorized**; `aiGroup_schedule` needs exactly one |
| entity | string | **Yes** | — | Entity type to query. Enum: `profile` / `campaign` / `adGroup` / `target` / `productAd` / `portfolio` / `placement` / `aiGroup` / `aiGroup_schedule` / `asin` / `automationRule`. Note: productLine info is nested inside `asin` entity results, not a separate `entity` value |
| userContext | string | **Yes** | — | User's original query + reason, max 100 chars |
| filters | object | No | {} | Filter conditions. Field names are **camelCase**, no `entity.` prefix, no `_` suffix (e.g. `campaignState`, not `campaign.campaignState_`) |
| orderBy | array[object] | No | [] | `[{"field": "fieldName", "direction": "DESC"}]` |
| select | array[string] | No | all fields | Return **only** these top-level fields (no nested paths), in the given order. Unknown fields are ignored (reported via `meta.hint`). Does not affect pagination. See "Trimming fields with `select`" below |
| page | int | No | 1 | Page number (1-based). **`page` ≤ 0 is an error**, not a fallback to 1. Ignored for `automationRule` and `aiGroup_schedule` |
| pageSize | int | No | 100 | Rows per page, max 500. **Out of range (≤0 or >500) is an error**, not clamped — floor any computed value at 1 |

## Trimming fields with `select`

When you only need a few fields, pass `select` to return just those — it noticeably shrinks the response and saves tokens. Rules:

- Field names use this tool's **plain camelCase** (e.g. `campaignState`) — **not** `get_ads_perf`'s `entity.field_` format.
- **Top-level fields only** — nested paths are not supported.
- Output order follows `select`; fields absent from a row are simply omitted; unknown field names are ignored and surfaced in `meta.hint` (with the first row's available fields).
- `select` **does not affect pagination** (`page`/`pageSize`/`hasNextPage` behave the same).
- ⚠️ **The `{field}Text` companion fields are NOT auto-included under `select`.** `select` is a strict projection: only the fields you list come back. If you still need the human-readable enum label (or will translate enums), you **must list both** the field and its `Text` companion, e.g. `["campaignState", "campaignStateText"]`. Selecting only `campaignState` returns the raw value `"paused"` — you won't get `"Paused"`.

## ⚠️ Field Naming Differs From `get_ads_perf`

This is the single most important thing to get right. `get_ads_perf` dimension fields use `entity.field_` (prefix + underscore suffix). **`get_entity_metadata` fields do NOT** — they are plain camelCase field names with no prefix and no suffix:

| Tool | Example |
|---|---|
| `get_ads_perf` (select/filters) | `campaign.campaignState_` |
| `get_entity_metadata` (filters/orderBy) | `campaignState` |

Do not copy the `get_ads_perf` field format into this tool — it will fail.

## `entity` Enum Values, Fields by Entity

**See [`references/field-reference.md`](references/field-reference.md)** for the complete field dictionary: entity enum values and backing providers, and all per-entity field tables (profile, campaign, adGroup, target, productAd, portfolio, placement, aiGroup, aiGroup_schedule, asin, automationRule) with filterable fields, enums, and usage examples.

## `entity: aiGroup_schedule` — managed-group schedules (special contract)

Reads the schedule ("flights", seasonal plans) of **one** AI managed group. Its calling contract is different from every other entity — the generic rules in this file do not apply as-is.

```json
{
  "userContext": "Show the schedule for managed group 29123",
  "entity": "aiGroup_schedule",
  "profileIds": [2618208845223116],
  "filters": {"aiGroupId": 29123}
}
```

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| `profileIds` | **Exactly one**, and authorized. Zero/many → `aiGroup_schedule query requires exactly one authorized profileId` |
| `filters` | **Must contain `aiGroupId` and nothing else.** Missing → `aiGroup_schedule query requires filters.aiGroupId`; extra keys → `aiGroup_schedule query only supports filters.aiGroupId` |
| `aiGroupId` value | A single positive integer. `29123`, `[29123]`, and `{"in": [29123]}` are all accepted; multiple IDs are not |
| Pagination | **Ignored.** Returns every schedule for that group in one call. The response omits `page`, `pageSize`, `hasNextPage` |
| `orderBy` | Ignored |

Consequences for how you use it:
- **Don't try to page it**, and don't apply the "count by looping pages" rule from the counting section above — `rowCount` here *is* the total number of schedules for the group.
- **One group per call.** To cover several groups, call once per `aiGroupId`, serially.
- Get `aiGroupId` from `entity: aiGroup` first (or from the user). It's the internal ID, same as `aiGroup.aiGroupId`.
- To find schedules across stores, loop stores one at a time — you cannot pass multiple `profileIds`.

Schedules define time-boxed overrides of the group's settings: a fixed date window (`timeType=1`) or a weekly repeat (`timeType=2`). Weekly schedules inherit `optimizeType`/`acos`/`aiPersonality` from the parent group rather than carrying their own — so when reporting a weekly schedule, read those three from the group, not the schedule row. Writing schedules is a separate tool (`save_sp_sb_ai_group_schedule`, SP/SB only) and is out of scope for this read skill.

## `entity: aiGroup` — you get the *currently effective* config, not the raw record

Two server-side transformations are applied to `aiActionSettings` / `aiAutomation` before you see them. Both remove fields. **A missing field means "not in effect right now" — it does not mean "not configured", and it never means "a write failed".**

**1. Trimmed by ad type.** The response only carries what's configurable for that `campaignType`:

| campaignType | What's absent |
|---|---|
| `sponsoredProducts` | nothing (full set); automation limited to the supported rule set |
| `sponsoredBrands` | `structOptimization`; and in `bidOptimization`: `bidAdPlaceStatus`, `bidAdPlaceRangeStatus`, `tosMin/tosMax`, `pdpMin/pdpMax`, `rosMin/rosMax`, `bidAmazonBusinessStatus`, `btbMin/btbMax`, `btbRangeStatus`; plus `targetPausedAddStatus` |
| `sponsoredDisplay` | `bidOptimization`, `structOptimization`, `brandOptimization`; in `budgetOptimization`: `budgetDaypartStatus`, `budgetDynamicStatus`, `numType`, `num`; the `negativeTarget*` family and `targetPausedAddStatus`; **all** automation rules |

If `campaignType` is missing or unrecognized, nothing is trimmed.

**2. Projected to what's actually effective.** On top of the trim:

- A switch that is **off** drops its dependent fields. `bidAdPlaceStatus=0` → no `tosMin/tosMax/pdpMin/pdpMax/rosMin/rosMax`. `btbRangeStatus=0` → no `btbMin/btbMax`. `bidRangeStatus=0` → no `bidRangeType`/`bidRange`. `brandedStatus=0` → no `brandedMatchType`/`brandedList`/`competitor*`; `competitorStatus=0` → no `competitorMatchType`/`competitorList`.
- A rule running in **AI mode** (`status=0`, or absent) is **omitted from `aiAutomation` entirely** — the system decides on its own, so there's no rule config to show.
- **Never interpret an empty `aiAutomation` by itself.** It can mean that all *enabled* rule-capable action spaces are AI-driven, that those action spaces are off, or a mixture of both. Read the paired `aiActionSettings` switches first; only an on switch with no retained Rule entry identifies AI mode for that action space.
- A rule running in **Rule mode** (`status=1`) keeps its config but drops AI-panel-only parameters (e.g. rule 181 drops `bidPerformanceStrictAcosStatus`; rule 17 drops `numType`/`num`).
- `targetPausedAddStatus=2` is reported as `1` in Rule mode (the AI-only sub-option is folded away).

**`aiAutomation.{ruleType}.status` is a mode discriminator, not an enable switch.** Never
translate `status=1` as "enabled" or `status=0` as "disabled". The paired
`aiActionSettings.*Status` switch determines whether the action space is on; when it is on,
`status=1` means Rule mode and an omitted Rule entry means AI mode.
**How to talk about this to a user:**

**Before presenting a managed-group configuration, read
[`references/managed-group-display.md`](references/managed-group-display.md).** It defines the
customer-facing language, UI grouping, setting labels, and rule names. Backend object names are
not product section names.
- Report what's present as the live configuration. For anything absent, say "not currently in effect" and, if relevant, name the switch that gates it — don't say "not set" and don't guess at a stored value.
- If the user asks "did my change save?", verify by reading the **switch** you set, then its dependents. Absent dependents under an off switch are expected, not evidence of failure.
- Don't diff two `aiGroup` reads field-by-field and call every disappearance a regression — flipping one switch off legitimately removes a whole family of fields from the response.
- If the user asks for the **full / complete managed-group configuration**, do not compress
  sibling controls into a phrase such as "bid adjustment + placement + range". Group the
  returned switches by the UI's Bid / Budget / Targeting / Structure sections and report each
  supported switch separately, including off switches. For every on, rule-capable switch, report
  AI vs Rule mode and then its dependent values. A field trimmed because the ad type does not
  support it is "unsupported / not exposed for this ad type", not "off".
- Map `targetType` through the managed-group display guide and preserve the UI's selected objective
  label in the user's language. For example, a Chinese answer for `targetType=2` says **保持订单稳定**.
  "控制成本" is only the surrounding category, and a returned English label such as "Optimize
  ROAS" must not replace the selected Chinese option.
- For managed groups and their schedules, display `aiPersonality` as the numeric level only, for
  example **AI 人格：4**. Do not replace or supplement it with `aiPersonalityText` labels such as
  "激进", "略激进", or "Aggressive".
- Treat bid-range values according to `bidRangeType`: numeric amount vs percentage. Never call a
  displayed currency range a coefficient, and never infer that placement adjustment is on merely
  because bid range is on.
- Do not show backend field names or rule numbers in a normal customer answer. Use localized UI
  names from the display guide. Raw keys/codes belong only in a separate technical appendix when
  explicitly requested.
- `brandOptimization` is not an action-space category. Present it separately as Brand/non-brand/
  competitor mode / 品牌/非品牌/竞品模式.

### Reading rule-mode (RBA) rule configuration

There are two different read surfaces; do not conflate them:

- `entity: "automationRule"` returns only the enabled `ruleType` codes and localized names for specified Amazon campaign IDs. It does **not** return template IDs/names, conditions, actions, frequency, applicable objects, or account-level template lists.
- `entity: "aiGroup"` (and, when present, `aiGroup_schedule`) returns the managed group's embedded action-space Rule configuration under `aiAutomation.{ruleType}`. This is not the account's standalone automation-template library.

When a managed group runs an action space in **Rule mode**, its effective configuration is readable under `aiAutomation.{ruleType}`: conditions, actions, condition items, time periods, and (for dayparting rules) the hour matrix. Rule types you may see: `2` bid dayparting, `4` target harvest, `5` negative target, `13` budget dayparting, `17` budget by performance, `19` placement adjustment, `20` pause campaign, `181` bid by performance, `182` target pause/supplement.

**Before explaining any rule configuration, read [`references/automation-rule-reading.md`](references/automation-rule-reading.md).** It defines the action-switch/mode decision, capability boundary, rule-specific business semantics, condition priority, and safe rendering procedure.

- Well-understood leaves carry a `...Text` companion for display (metric names, logical connectors, action types, placements, periods, hour labels). Leaves whose value domain isn't confirmed are passed through **raw, with no Text** — relay those verbatim and don't invent a label for them.
- The same raw value can mean different things in different rules (e.g. `amount` under rule 17 is a budget action, under rule 19 it's a placement bid action). Never carry a label across rule types.
- **This is read-only.** There is no MCP tool that writes RBA rule configuration — see `xnurta-edit-ai-group`. You can show a user their rule setup and explain it; you cannot offer to change it here. Also note the direction constraint: a rule-based group can be switched to AI, but not the reverse.

## Filter Syntax

Field names are **camelCase, no prefix/suffix** (different from `get_ads_perf`!).

```json
{
  "campaignState": "enabled",
  "campaignId": [123, 456],
  "campaignName": {"like": "%test%"},
  "AND": [
    {"campaignState": "enabled"},
    {"campaignName": {"like": "%brand%"}}
  ],
  "OR": [
    {"campaignState": "enabled"},
    {"campaignState": "paused"}
  ]
}
```

**Supported operators**:

| Operator | Meaning | Backend op | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `=` (bare value) | Equals | eq | `{"campaignState": "enabled"}` |
| `!=` | Not equals | ne | `{"campaignState": {"!=": "archived"}}` |
| `like` | Fuzzy match | like (case-insensitive) | `{"campaignName": {"like": "%test%"}}` |
| `in` | In list | in | `{"campaignState": {"in": ["enabled", "paused"]}}` |
| `notin` | Not in list | notin | `{"campaignState": {"notin": ["archived"]}}` |
| `>=`, `<=` | Range | between | `{"dailyBudget": {">=": 10, "<=": 100}}` |
| `>`, `<` | Range | between | `{"defaultBid": {">": 0.5, "<": 2}}` |

**Note on `like`**: any `%` you include is stripped and replaced with an automatic leading+trailing `%` — the match is always "contains" regardless of where you place `%`.

## Enum "Text" Companion Fields

For enum-valued fields, the response **automatically appends a human-readable `{field}Text` companion field** — but **only when you do NOT use `select`**. If you pass `select`, this auto-append does not happen; you must list each `xxxText` field explicitly (see "Trimming fields with `select`" above). Example (no `select`):
```json
{
  "campaignState": "enabled",
  "campaignStateText": "Enabled",
  "campaignType": "sponsoredProducts",
  "campaignTypeText": "Sponsored Products",
  "biddingStrategy": "autoForSales",
  "biddingStrategyText": "SP Dynamic bids - up and down"
}
```

Fields that get this treatment: all `*State` fields (campaignState/adGroupState/targetState/portfolioState/productAdState), all `*ServingStatus` fields, `campaignType`, `biddingStrategy`, `targetingType`/`targetMatchType`/`matchType`, `placement`, `costType`/`budgetType`/`portfolioBudgetType`, `aiStatus`/`aiTargetType`/`aiPersonality`, `asinInventoryStatus`/`asinSpEligibilityStatus`/`asinIsDelete`, generic `xxxStatus` (0/1) flags, `countryCode`, `isAiCreate`/`sdBidOptimization`/`profileUseBudgetCap`.

Customer-display exception: for managed-group `aiPersonality`, keep the raw numeric level `1`-`5`
as the displayed value. Do not substitute its `Text` companion; see the managed-group display guide.

**Exception**: `automationRule.enabledRuleNames` is already a human-readable string array — there is no separate `Text` field for it.

## Response Structure

```json
{
  "isError": false,
  "toolName": "get_entity_metadata",
  "rows": [
    {
      "campaignId": 826117,
      "amazonCampaignId": "298539385213868",
      "campaignName": "Brand-SP-Auto-US",
      "campaignType": "sponsoredProducts",
      "campaignState": "enabled",
      "biddingStrategy": "autoForSales",
      "targetingType": "auto",
      "dailyBudget": 50.0,
      "currentBudget": 50.0,
      "portfolioId": "12345",
      "aiGroupId": "501"
    }
  ],
  "rowCount": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "pageSize": 100,
  "hasNextPage": false,
  "effectiveProfileIds": [4404871489220462],
  "requestId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `isError` | boolean | Whether the call errored — check this before reading `rows` |
| `toolName` | string | Tool name |
| `requestId` | string | Trace ID — quote it when reporting a failure to the user. May be absent locally |
| `rows` | array[object] | Result rows — fields depend on `entity` |
| `rowCount` | int | Row count on current page |
| `page` / `pageSize` | int | Pagination state. **Absent** for `aiGroup_schedule` (non-paginated) |
| `hasNextPage` | boolean | Whether more pages exist. **Absent** for `aiGroup_schedule` |
| `effectiveProfileIds` | array[long] | Profile IDs the query ran against — an echo of your request (unauthorized IDs fail the call outright) |
| `meta.hint` | string | Present when something was adjusted silently, e.g. `Unknown select fields ignored: [...]` — read it |

On error, the response instead follows the shared error envelope described in Platform-Wide Rules above (two shapes: `errorType` for tool errors, `error` for pipeline errors). A missing `entity` param surfaces as `errorType: invalid_params`.

## Notes

- `entity` is **required** — this is the #1 cause of failed calls. Do not call this tool without it. Enum includes `aiGroup_schedule` (managed-group schedules)
- Each page returns up to `pageSize` rows (max 500); use `page` for pagination and check `hasNextPage`. Exceptions: `automationRule` and `aiGroup_schedule` ignore pagination entirely. An out-of-range `pageSize`/`page` is an **error**, not clamped
- `profileIds` is **required**. Always call `get_user_authorized_context` first. If the user doesn't name a store, pass all authorized `profileIds`
- **Every requested `profileId` must be authorized** — one bad value fails the whole call. `aiGroup_schedule` additionally requires exactly one
- `aiGroup` results are a **projection of the currently effective config** (trimmed by ad type, then reduced to what's actually in effect) — an absent field means "not in effect", not "unset" and not "write failed". See the dedicated section above
- Rule-mode (RBA) rule configuration **is readable** under `aiGroup`'s `aiAutomation.{ruleType}`; it is **not writable** through any MCP tool
- No `dateStart`/`dateEnd` or `metrics` needed — and no historical/point-in-time snapshot capability either (no date params of any kind on this tool)
- `groupBy` is not applicable here — this tool returns entity rows, not aggregates
- User says "ASIN" -> default to child ASIN, use entity `asin`, field `asin`
- `profile` **can** be queried standalone as its own entity
- `automationRule` **requires** `amazonCampaignId` in filters, and does not support sort/pagination
- `automationRule` is an enabled-type lookup, not a template/configuration query. There is no current metadata entity for listing the account's standalone automation templates or reading their full configuration
- Product inventory rules are associated at SKU/product level and are not exposed by the campaign-scoped `automationRule` entity or managed-group `aiAutomation`; do not report them as absent based on either query
- `campaignStartDate`/`campaignEndDate` use `YYYYMMDD` (Ymd) — different from the `YYYY-MM-DD` used by `dateStart`/`dateEnd` on the other two tools
- For campaign rows, `campaignId` is the internal integer ID used by managed-group write tools; `amazonCampaignId` is the Amazon ID used to link performance/log data. Never substitute one for the other
- `asin` entity's currency handling is the one exception to "multi-profile = USD" — check each row's `currency` field
- When querying across multiple `profileIds`, verify whether the entity's rows carry a `profileId` field (e.g. `asin` does); if not, query per-profile or cross-reference before merging
- `targetAcos` (aiGroup entity) is confirmed ×100/percentage, same as performance `ACOS` — don't re-scale, but append `%` when presenting it
- Only use field names listed in this doc's per-entity tables; never invent field names
- Field naming here (camelCase, no prefix/suffix) is **different** from `get_ads_perf` (`entity.field_`) — do not mix the two conventions
- On error, check `errorType` and handle per the guidance above
