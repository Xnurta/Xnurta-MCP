# Action-space & budget coupling rules (SP / SB / SD)

The first bullets cover SP/SB `aiActionSettings`; sections further down also cover SD and
the group-total-budget behavior. `aiActionSettings` is not just on/off switches - several switches are meaningless (or
fail / fall back to unintended defaults) unless you also send their companion fields.
When enabling one, include the whole set. These are front-end-enforced linkages; MCP
won't enforce them, so you must. (Exact field names: `field-reference.md`.)

- **Dynamic budget** (`budgetDynamicActionStatus=1`) -> also `budgetNumType`
  (`1`=percentage / `2`=fixed) and `budgetNum` (the value). Value bounds (the batch path
  uses `budgetDynamicStatus`/`numType`/`num`): `num > 0`; `numType=1` (percentage)
  `num <= 1000`; `numType=2` (fixed) `num <= 100000`.
  **Use percentage mode (`1`) whenever the operation spans stores in different currencies** -
  a fixed amount has no single meaning across currencies, and nothing on the backend stops
  you from applying one uniformly. If the user asks for a fixed increase across a
  mixed-currency set, either convert per store and write per store, or switch them to a
  percentage and say why.
- **Bid range** (`bidRangeStatus=1`) -> also `bidRangeType` and `bidRange` `[min,max]`
  (array length exactly 2, **min <= max**). `bidRangeType=1` (percentage): `0.01 <= min`
  and `max <= 100`. `bidRangeType=2` (fixed): `min >=` the site's minimum bid. Note:
  **BidDaypart and BidAdjustment share this one `bidRange`** - if both are on it applies
  to both.
- **B2B range** (`btbRangeStatus=1`) -> `btbMin`/`btbMax`: `btbMin >= 0`, `btbMax <= 900`,
  min <= max, at least one end non-null.
- **Placement ranges** (`bidAdPlaceRangeStatus=1`) -> **at least one** of the `tos*`/
  `pdp*`/`ros*` min/max pairs non-null (don't enable the switch with all null); each pair
  `min >= 0`, `max <= 900`, min <= max.

## Performance budget (按表现调预算) and budget reallocation (预算重新分配) are linked

**按表现调预算** (`DYNAMIC_BUDGET`) - the value is an **increase cap on top of the current
budget, NOT a target**. Mode `1`=percentage (`+num%`), `2`=fixed (`+$num`). **Fields by
path:** SP/SB action space `budgetDynamicActionStatus`+`budgetNumType`+`budgetNum`; SD
`budgetDynamicStatus`+`numType`+`num`; batch = per the `DYNAMIC_BUDGET` schema.

**预算重新分配** (`BUDGET_REDISTRIBUTE`) - a switch that **changes the scope of 按表现调预算**.
**Fields by path:** SP/SB action space `budgetRedistributeActionStatus`; SD
`budgetRedistributeStatus`; batch = per the `BUDGET_REDISTRIBUTE` schema.

**Scope - worked example.** A group with two enabled campaigns at **$100** and **$200**
(group total **$300**), 按表现调预算 value = **20**:

| 预算重新分配 | mode | how it applies | group max |
|---|---|---|---|
| OFF | fixed 20 | each campaign +$20 ($100->$120, $200->$220) | **$340** |
| OFF | percent 20% | each campaign +20% ($100->$120, $200->$240) | **$360** |
| ON | fixed 20 | whole group ($300 + $20) | **$320** |
| ON | percent 20% | whole group ($300 + 20%) | **$360** |

- **OFF = per enabled campaign** (each campaign's own daily budget may rise by the cap).
- **ON = whole group** - you can only determine the **group-level** cap; you **cannot**
  infer how much each individual campaign will end up with.
- **Fixed vs percentage give different results** once campaign budgets differ - the
  single-campaign "$100 -> $120" case hides this, so always distinguish the two modes.
- **Whether to ask:** at **create**, the user must specify the mode (fixed/percent) and
  预算重新分配 on/off. At **edit**, read the current 预算重新分配 first and **keep it unless
  the user asked to change it** (state it in the preview). **Only ask** when the mode, the
  scope, or the user's intent is still ambiguous. Either way, always make clear the number
  is an *increase* (not a target) and show the full impact before executing.

## Group total budget (托管组总预算) rescales campaigns proportionally

托管组总预算 / group total budget = the **sum of the group's enabled campaigns' daily
budgets** (`totalBudget` / `totalDailyBudget` on read reflect this). **Editing the group
total proportionally rescales every enabled campaign's daily budget** to the new total -
it is not an isolated field. State this effect in the change preview.

## Strict ACOS / ACOS priority mode (`bidPerformanceStrictAcosStatus`)

Page name **"ACOS 优先模式 / ACOS priority mode"** (a.k.a. Strict ACOS / strict ROAS). It's
a **checkbox under 按表现调价 (bid-by-performance)** that makes the AI cut bids harder and
faster when ACOS is badly off target. Field: `bidPerformanceStrictAcosStatus` (`0`/`1`).

- **SP only** - SB and SD do not support it; don't send it for them.
- **Requires ALL of these together, or it will NOT trigger** (don't claim it's active
  otherwise): `targetType=2` (Maintain Stability / 保持稳定) **and** `bidPerformanceStatus=1`
  (按表现调价 on, AI mode) **and** `aiPersonality >= 3`. Enabling it means setting/confirming
  all three; `aiPersonality` 1-2 never triggers it.
- **Auto Pacing wins:** if the group's `isAutoPacing` is on, Strict ACOS is **paused** until
  Auto Pacing is turned off. Read `isAutoPacing` and tell the user if it will be suppressed.
- **Scope:** affects **base bid only** (not targeting / budget / negatives); no weekday
  scheduling (date-range only).
- **Early Access / permission-gated:** the account/group may not have it enabled. If the
  switch doesn't stick on read-back, tell the user it's Early Access (access-controlled) -
  don't report it as a silent failure of your call.
- **It's a tradeoff** - it can **underspend budget and reduce orders** in exchange for
  hitting ACOS. **Confirm this tradeoff with the user before enabling**, and don't turn it
  on by default for every stability-target group.

## Word-list fields are not supported

All word-list settings are currently unsupported, including branded, non-branded,
competitor, negative-target blacklist, and target-harvest blacklist settings. **Do not
send their status, list ID, match-type, or list-type fields for SP, SB, or SD**, even if
the routed schema exposes them. Tell the user to configure word lists in the platform.

## Disabling an action space doesn't clear its follow-up fields

Turning an action space off (its `*Status=0`) only updates that status - the backend does
**not** zero out the range/companion values you set before (confirmed 2026-08-14). To
change a follow-up value you must re-send it.
